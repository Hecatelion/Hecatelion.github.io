			<h2>Pitch, Context &amp; Trivia</h2>
			<p>A little party game in which Tom and Luna, two kids playing in their room are trying to make their space ship reach the moon, fighting aliens and repairing machines! <br>This was the second Jam I participated in but the first Global Game Jam! For this occasion my team and I had decided to work with Unreal Engine 4 to improve our understanding of this engine, that at this moment we didn't know well. We had chosen to create a casual party game so that it will be easy to understand and playable by most of the players. The theme announced was "Repair" and we wanted to make a game where kids were just having fun, such as us, grown kids having fun in a jam!</p>
