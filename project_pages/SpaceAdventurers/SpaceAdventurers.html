				<li>dev duration : 2 game jam days (pretty intense!)</li>
				<li>engine, langage : Unreal Engine 4, Blueprint</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Pitch, Context &amp; Trivia</h2>
			<p>A little party game in which Tom and Luna, two kids playing in their room try to make their space ship reach the moon, fighting aliens and repairing machines! <br>This was the second Jam I participated but the first Global Game Jam! For this occasion my team and I had decided to do it working with Unreal Engine to improve our understanding of this engine, that at this moment we didn't know well. We had chosen to create a casual party game so that it will be easy to understand and playable by most of the players. The theme announced was "Repair" and we wanted to make a game where kids were just having fun, such as us, grown kids having fun in a jam!</p>
