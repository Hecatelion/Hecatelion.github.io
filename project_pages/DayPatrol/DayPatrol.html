			<h2>Characteristics</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>game type : Top-down driving mini-game</li>
				<li>team : 1 programmer, 1 programmer/designer, 3 artists</li>
				<li>dev duration : 2 game jam days (pretty intense, not gonna lie)</li>
				<li>engine, langage : Unity C#</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Pitch, Context &amp; Trivia</h2>
			<p>An high-speed pursuit in which you, the cop, has to catch the thief before he reaches the airport. <br>
			This was our first game jam, organized by our school Creajeux (NÃ®mes), in which we had to create a game with the theme "the police" in order to be playable on a game fair taking place in a police school. Our team was composed of 3 3rd year student (me and 2 friends of mine) and 2 1st year student that we didn't know. We wanted to build a mix team with half experimented student to guide newbies if needed and offer them the opportunity of doing their first game project with reassuring people. Everything went well except that at a point we had to decide wether we kept our 1st concept but taking the risk of not having a playable game at the end, or switch to a simplest concept to be sure our game would be playable. That was a tough decision that the programmers had to make (because the issu was linked to the coding part) and we decided to chose the "simplification" option, so our artists could have their work shown and useful. That was a bit frustrating, but team goes first!</p>
